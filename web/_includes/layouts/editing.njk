      <p>“A rising tide lifts all boats.” This famous quote embodies what I love most about publishing: When a person falls in love with a book, they become a reader for life.</p> 
      <p>WhenAfter devouring one story, they are hunting for their next read.</p>
      <p>My road to publication was not an easy one. I spent about a decade writing five unique novels, all of them in the 400-page range, and every single one of them was rejected. I thought of giving up so many times—yet if I hadn’t picked myself up to work on novel number six, I wouldn’t be writing this right now.</p>
      <p>So, for those of you feeling broken by rejection, I’m here to tell you to keep going. Do not give up on yourself. All it takes is ONE yes.</p>
      <p>Over the years, I’ve often thought about ways to pay it forward and make it easier for the next writer to make it past the gatekeepers. I spent a few years mentoring aspiring authors through Las Musas, and now I’ve decided to start offering consulting, coaching, and editing services.</p>
      <p>My bio says I’m a Virgo to the core, which is code for I’m big on organization. I like to make a plan I can stick to, and I build a solid structure for my books before I begin drafting, so that I always know where I’m headed. As you can probably tell from my bibliography, I particularly enjoy world building because I’m very detail oriented. These skill sets are transferable across genres, so even if you’re not writing fantasy or YA, I can still help you lay the foundation for your project so that you can see it through to completion.</p>
      <p>My goal is to help you produce a manuscript that is ready for querying agents, putting you on the path to landing a book deal. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions, and I look forward to speaking with you.</p>
      <p>Happy writing!</p>
